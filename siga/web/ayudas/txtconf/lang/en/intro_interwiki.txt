====== Text Config Manager: Interwiki  ======

Use this page to Manage the Interwiki List of your Dokuwiki installation.\\
What are Interwiki? refer to [[doku>wiki:interwiki]].

Each URL may contain one of the placeholders {URL} or {NAME}
  * ''{URL}'' is replaced by the URL encoded representation of the wikiname this is the right thing to do in most cases
  * ''{NAME}'' this is replaced by the wikiname as given in the document no further encoding is done
If no placeholder is defined the urlencoded name is appended to the URL

Please note that you may specify an image to use with interwiki links in your dokuwiki's ''images/interwiki'' directory. Unfortunately, this plugin does not upload image files.
